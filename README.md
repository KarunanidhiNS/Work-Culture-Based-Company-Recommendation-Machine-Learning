**About Algorithm**

**Random Forest** is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to create a robust and accurate predictive model. It introduces randomization during the training process by considering random subsets of the training data and random subsets of features for each split, mitigating overfitting and improving generalization. Through bagging, where multiple decision trees are trained independently on different subsets of the data, Random Forest reduces variance and provides reliable predictions. It is effective for both classification and regression tasks, handling large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces efficiently. Additionally, Random Forest offers insights into feature importance, aiding in feature selection. Despite its advantages, Random Forest models can be computationally expensive.
